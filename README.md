# **Book Ratings Analysis**


**Project Overview**

This notebook explores a dataset of book ratings to understand user preferences and identify patterns in reading behavior. The dataset includes information about books, their authors, publication years, and ratings from different users. I began by loading and cleaning the dataset, addressing missing values, and ensuring consistent formatting for book titles and author names. The primary goal was to explore trends in ratings, popular books, and active users while uncovering insights that could guide future book recommendations.

**Methods & Results**

I performed exploratory data analysis to examine how ratings are distributed across books and users. Visualizations revealed that while most books received moderate ratings, a smaller subset consistently achieved high scores. Popular authors and titles were identified by grouping and ranking the data. I also explored how user activity levels correlated with rating behavior, finding that highly active users tend to give a broader range of ratings. These insights provide valuable direction for building recommendation systems and understanding reader engagement.

**Key Outputs**

- Cleaned and structured book ratings dataset
- Distribution analysis of ratings across books and users
- Lists of most-rated and highest-rated books and authors
- Visualizations of rating patterns and user engagement trends
- Insights into the relationship between rating activity and book popularity

**Conclusion**

This analysis highlights clear trends in how readers rate books, which authors and titles dominate popularity charts, and how user engagement shapes rating patterns. These findings can inform the design of personalized recommendation systems and help publishers, libraries, and booksellers better understand what readers want.
